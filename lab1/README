Main program is based off of cppstrtok in the class website. 
The function cpplines is slightly altered from being a void 
to returning a pointer to the stringset,as per spec. 
The pointer to stringset is stored in const* char stringset in main.
Error handling is now in it's own cpp implementation file, auxlib.

To supress warning messages about unused variables (which
we will use in future assignments), line 129 has a 
filler print statement.

Hashing function based off of string_set.cpp 
in the class website,unaltered.

Error messages handled by auxlib.cpp in the class website.
Added check in eprintf for insufficient program arguments. (Line 62)

Makefile provided by class website in cppstrtok folder.

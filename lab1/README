Main program is based off of cppstrtok in the class website. 
The function cpplines is slightly altered from being a void 
to returning the stringset as a string pointer,as per spec.
To supress warning messages, the call to cpplines does 
not store the stringset to a variable in main(). 
In the future, for the other modules to work off of the stringset,
the stringset will be stored as a local pointer, 
name stringset, in main().

Hashing function based off of string_set.cpp 
in the class website,unaltered.

BUILD: make
TEST: make test
note: make test will use the path relative to 
the unix timeshare to draw examples from.
